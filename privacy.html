PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: 12 January 2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the MyBizzCard mobile application (“App”, “we”, “us”, “our”) handles information. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.

Contact: mybizzzcard@gmail.com

---------------------------------------
1. INFORMATION WE DO NOT STORE ON OUR SERVERS
---------------------------------------
We operate a secure processing server to enable AI features.
This server does not store business card images, OCR text, or extracted contact data.
We do not create user accounts.

Your scanned results are saved only on your device (and optionally your phonebook if you choose to save there).

---------------------------------------
2. OFFLINE PROCESSING (FREE PLAN)
---------------------------------------
Offline scanning runs on your device. When you use offline features, card images and text are processed locally.

Examples:
- Scan Card (offline)
- QR Scan on Card (offline)
- Save Cropped Card (saved locally on your device)
- Manual card creation

---------------------------------------
3. AI FEATURES (OPENAI PROCESSING)
---------------------------------------
The App includes AI-powered extraction. When AI is used, the App securely sends either:
- OCR text extracted on your device, or
- A card image (depending on the feature and mode)

to OpenAI for processing. OpenAI returns structured card fields to your device.

AI limits in the App:
• Free Plan: a limited number of lifetime AI scans
• AI Pro Plan: a monthly AI usage quota, subject to plan conditions shown in the App

We do not store the submitted OCR text or card images on our servers.

OpenAI processes data under its own Privacy Policy and Terms.

---------------------------------------

4. ADVERTISING
---------------------------------------
The current version of the App does not display third-party advertisements and does not integrate any ad networks.

No business card images, extracted text, or contact data are shared with any advertising partners.

If advertisements are added in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be updated before they are enabled.

5. PAYMENTS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS
---------------------------------------
Subscriptions and payments are handled by Google Play.
We do not collect or store payment card information.

---------------------------------------
6. ERROR LOGS & PERFORMANCE
---------------------------------------
We may receive anonymized crash/performance information from Google Play Console.
This information does not include business card images or extracted contact data.

---------------------------------------
7. SECURITY
---------------------------------------
AI requests are transmitted using encrypted HTTPS connections.
Users are responsible for securing their own devices and controlling what they scan.

---------------------------------------
8. DATA RETENTION
---------------------------------------
We do not retain business card images or extracted text on our servers.
Data processed by OpenAI is handled under OpenAI’s policies.

---------------------------------------
9. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
---------------------------------------
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect children’s personal information.

---------------------------------------
10. CHANGES
---------------------------------------
We may update this Policy from time to time. Continued use of the App means you accept the updated Policy.

---------------------------------------
11. GOVERNING LAW
---------------------------------------
This Policy is governed by the laws of Türkiye.
Disputes may be resolved by the competent courts of Istanbul unless otherwise required by law.

---------------------------------------
