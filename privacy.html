PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: 12 January 2026

MyBizzCard respects your privacy.

1) Offline features
Offline scanning runs on your device. You may save extracted contact details locally and/or to your phonebook based on your actions.

2) AI features (OpenAI processing)
Some features use AI-powered extraction. When AI is used, the App securely sends either OCR text extracted on your device (from on-device OCR) or a card image (depending on the feature and mode) to our secure processing server, which then sends the data to OpenAI for recognition and extraction. OpenAI returns structured card fields to your device.

AI limits:
- Free Plan: up to 3 lifetime AI scans (using OCR text after on-device OCR)
- AI Pro: up to 1000 AI scans per month

3) Storage
We do not store business card images, OCR text, or extracted contact data on our servers. Any saved results remain on your device (and optionally your phonebook if you choose to save there).

4) Advertising
The current version of the App does not display third-party advertisements and does not integrate any ad networks.
If advertisements are added in a future version, this Privacy Policy will be updated before they are enabled.
We do not share card images, OCR text, or extracted contact data with advertisers.

5) Your responsibility
You are responsible for ensuring you have permission to scan and store another person’s contact details and for complying with applicable laws.
